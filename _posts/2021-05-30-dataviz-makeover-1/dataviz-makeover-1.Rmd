# **1 Critique of Visualisation**

The original visualisation can be seen below.

![](pic/1.png)

### 1.1 Clarity

1. Area chart makes it difficult to gage height. Two areas overlap and looks messy. Also, area chart doesn&#39;t show the data is a time-series data.
2. Title (2019-2020) and content (2019-2021) are not consistent.
3. Inconsistent Y-axis for different countries makes it hard to compare. For e.g. Some use 0-6M, some use 0-8M, some use 0-2M.
4. Secondary axis makes it hard to compare import and export data.
5. X-axis should use title &#39;Year of period&#39; as it only shows Year.
6. Data source not included.
7. Annotations are not used meaning this is no further elucidation for the graph.

### 1.2 Aesthetic

1. Format of axes: vertical title of Y-axis
2. Horrible color choice for import and export, not distinctive.
3. Ugly font size: Title is smaller than the country name.
4. Gird lines already out the graph.
5. No any picture included.

# 2 Alternative Design

The proposed design is as follows.

![](pic/2.jpg)

### 2.1 Clarity

1. Use line chart to show the time-series data, which shows the trend clearly.

2. Different regions use the same Y axis and they are in the same row, makes it easy and clear to compare. Also imports and exports use the same axis, makes it easy to compare these 2 categories.

3. Have title and sub-title to emphasize the key observations.

4. Have trend line to show the important date and use annotations to show details.

### 2.2 Aesthetic

1. Call-outs with images aid cognition.

2. Tick marks are used for years.

3. Data source and image source is included.

# 4 Step-by-step Guide


 1  Import the data into Tableau. 
 ![](pic/3.png) 
 
 2  Use prep cleaning 
 ![](pic/4.png)
 
 3 Use Tableau to pivot the data in sheet. Do the same with T2.  
 ![](pic/5.png) 
 ![](pic/6.png) 
 
 4  Change the relationship for T1 and T2 like this. 
 ![](pic/7.png) 
 
 5  Change the data type and name for T1 and T2 in the worksheet. 
 ![](pic/8.png) 
 
 6  Use filter to get the country and date we want. 
 ![](pic/9.png) 
 ![](pic/10.png) 
 
 7  Drag the columns and rows from data. 
 ![](pic/11.png) 
 
 8  Choose line graph. 
 ![](pic/12.png) 
 
 9  Change date(year) to date(month) 
 ![](pic/13.png) 
 
 10  Add title, sub-title, sources 
 ![](pic/14.png) 
 
 11  Change Y axis, use the same range for imports and exports, then hide one of the Y axis.

 ![](pic/16.png) 
 ![](pic/17.png) 
 
 12  Remove the title for X axis and Y axis. 
 ![](pic/18.png) 
 ![](pic/19.png) 
 
 13  Change format to get the tick marks for both axes. 
 ![](pic/20.png) 
 ![](pic/21.png) 
 
 14  Add grid lines for row. 
 ![](pic/22.png) 
 
 15  Hide field labels &#39;country&#39;.
 ![](pic/23.png) 
 
 16  Change the region names. Remove &#39;Thousand dollars&#39;. 
 ![](pic/24.png) 
 
 17  Add a reference line. 
 ![](pic/25.png) ![](pic/26.png)
 
 18  Change the reference line looking and add marks. 
 ![](pic/27.png)
 ![](pic/28.png)
 ![](pic/29.png) 
 
 19  Create a dashboard and drag the graph into it. 
 ![](pic/30.png) 
 
 20  Set the labels floating. 
 ![](pic/31.png) 
 
 21  Insert an image object and adjust its size. 
 ![](pic/32.png) 
 ![](pic/33.png) 
 
 22  Adjust the graph size for better looking and now it looks like this.

# 5 Derived Insights

1. In 2020 Mar, when COVID-19 outbroke, all 6 regions get influenced and their imports and exports amount both declined. After a quarter, merchandise trade for these 6 regions begin to recover.
